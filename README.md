This repo contains files for a mini-project to launch an AWS webserver that will display a web page with a message. 

There are 3 methods available to accomplish this within the project: 

1. Boto - python interface to AWS
2. Chef - knife-ec2 plugin
3. Cloud Formation - AWS JSON template file

Instructions for each method are located in the README of each directory.
